a) T (n) = 3T (n/2) + n

Time Complexity :- Θ(n^log2(3))

b) T (n) = 64T (n/8) − n^2(log n)

Time Complexity :- NA since f(n) is negative

c) T (n) = 2nT (n/2) + n^n

Time Complexity :- NA since "a" is not constant

d) T (n) = 3T (n/3) + n/2

Time Complexity :- Θ(nlogN)

e) .T (n) = 7T (n/3) + n^2

Time Complexity :- Θ(n^2)
